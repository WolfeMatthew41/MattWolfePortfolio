            VRGame is a game in the VR or virtual reality genre. 
            The concept for this game is a simple one that puts the player in a location such as a forest or a warehouse. 
            Finally, the player can look around the map, pick up a paintball gun and fire it at objects.

            A map developed in the project puts the player in a warehouse. 
            The player can shoot at a button in this warehouse map to turn off gravity. Having turned gravity off, 
            the player can fire at objects that will fly into the air and act without gravity.

            The project was developed for VR and worked with the HTC Vive.

            My role in the VRGame was to coordinate my group members and development. 
            I developed a warehouse map with the gravity function. Another part I played was fixing the errors that happened. 
            Lastly, I also got the paintball gun-running so that it could fire paintball projectiles.

            The VRGame was developed for my senior design project in college during 2020-2021.
