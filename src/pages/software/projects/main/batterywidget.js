            <p>
            The Vatista Battery Widget is a widget designed for the Android platform. 
            With the widget installed, the user can have their battery percent displayed along with their other apps and widgets. 
            There is also art for the character Vatista from the game "Under Night In-Birth" for different percent levels. 
            This project was for me, so I figured I would not have to worry about any copyright infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
            I was the sole developer for this project, and all of the programming, artwork, planning, and execution were done by me.
            </p>
            <p>
            I wanted to build this project due to a battery widget I downloaded before going out of date. 
            Although the mobile device told the battery percentage, having that widget gave a feeling of life and control. 
            Thus, I decided to build my custom battery widget with my coding and art skill level. 
            I was also into playing as Vatista at the time, hence why I based it on her.
