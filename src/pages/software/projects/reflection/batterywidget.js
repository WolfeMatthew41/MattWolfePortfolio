            The most I learned from this project is working with an Android application. 
            Coding was primarily done in Java; I learned how to adapt that coding into the widget application in Android Studio. 
            I also learned some XML coding that would be used for designing the widget.
            </p>
            <p>
            Where my skill level was at, there would be nothing I would do differently for the project. 
            I would say I executed the procedure well.
            </p>
            <p>
            If there were anything I could do to make the widget better would be the artwork. 
            Given that I developed the application in the past, my art skills have steadily improved. 
            Although describing my artwork would be used for another portfolio than one for coding such as this. 
            Thus, there would be nothing I would do to improve my coding.
