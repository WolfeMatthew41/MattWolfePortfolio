            There were several things that I learned in the process of this project. 
            One is working with a game designing program—which we used Unity, 
            and another is the use of coding in the Unity engine environment. Lastly, 
            I learned how to set up version control to allow our group to work on it simultaneously.

            <p>
            There is not much I would do differently on reflection of the project. 
            Our group had a high hurdle set at the start, not allowing us to work on the project. 
            That hurdle was that the lab for us to work in was not set up until the end of the first semester. 
            Thankfully, we could get to work in the second semester for the two-part class.
            </p>

            If there were something I would change, 
            it would be practicing development of an updated version during the first semester. 
            I would also attempt to fix any errors due to having us update to a recent version of Unity. 
            However, it was impossible to tell it needed to be done until we had the lab running.
            </p>
            <p>
            What I could do differently now is plan better. 
            I now understand how the engine system works and how to code for it—making a better plan based on that knowledge, 
            unlike before.
            </p>

            The main things I would do to improve the project would be fixing multiplayer and expanding on my ideas. 
            We attempted to make an online multiplayer for the game but ran into an issue that could not be resolved. 
            That issue was that we could not get two computers to connect. This feature was not part of my role in the project, 
            but it would be a feature that would have been neat for the project.

            It was nearing the end of the class when I found myself very comfortable working with the Unity engine. 
            Several ideas hung in my head that I wish to have played with. 
            One was giving the player the ability to teleport across the map. 
            We made it so the player could only move based on their real-world position and not allow any analog movement. 
            Having a teleportation item could enable the player to transport anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
            The other idea is something akin to space invaders. 
            We could have the player defending a center as countless objects or characters would come rushing towards you. 
            Thus, the player would have to guard against numerous waves of enemies until they lose.
            </p>
            <p>
            The logic for this idea would require more time than we had left. 
            Unfortunately, that did not allow us to expand on what we could do.
