            My planning for the project was somewhat limited, and I mostly jumped in already having an idea for how it 
            should function. Most of the planning would be done in the project's artwork, 
            and I spent more time sketching out how the design should be before ultimately coding it.

            I did have to plan how I wanted the percentages to work for the bar. Since I was the artist, 
            I thought it would make things easier to make 99 bar images than try to figure out the logic behind a 
            progress bar that curved perfectly to my outline.

            How I organized the code would be about as standard as you could get for an Android Studio project. 
            There are XML files for display and Java files for functionality, and the Java file I used some comment 
            labeling to keep it organized.

            Building the project was pretty simple, as I followed many instructions and tutorials to help me 
            understand development in Android Studio. Combining that with my understanding of Java allowed me to build the project.

            There were times when it just would not work. When I encountered those issues, 
            I made notes of where it wasnâ€™t working and trial and errored using online resources to figure them out. 
            Eventually, I resolved the errors that were preventing its functionality.
