            I planned for the project to start with practice before development. 
            I needed to practice before development because this was a new environment. 
            We were working in the Unity engine that utilized C# coding. 
            Some technical difficulties did not allow us to develop the project immediately. 
            Thus, I did some practice building a stage of my own to get used to the editor.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I was able to develop in the project, I already had an outline of concepts our project advisor listed, 
            and these concepts were what I then began to pour into the project. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Given that the project was built in Unity, there was an editor and code relationship. 
            I made most of the code function for a particular feature, such as firing the paintball gun. 
            The code was not developed in a single C# file as I made an individual file per feature set. 
            However, for coding each file, there isn’t too much organization. 
            Thankfully the files never got too long to require proper labels.

            The project's development was mainly like trying to build a Lego design—I used many references online. 
            Whenever I needed a specific thing to be manipulated, such as adjusting an object's speed or adding collision rules, 
            I would find the code required for that process. Through much trial and error, 
            I learned about the specific code lines in C# for Unity that would be necessary—
            having gone through that process allowed for a seamless development process for adding more code reusing existing code.

            In the debugging department, most of it was done in the editor. If there were an error, 
            it would show up in the editor. 
            Most of the mistakes I had to fix for the project were due to updating to a newer version of Unity. 
            With that update, many lines of code or features in the old editor were outdated and had to be corrected. 
            One of these fixes was the input system. Unity used to accept a simple check if the button was pressed in a C# script. 
            With the update, I had to use a new input system organized by the editor and not C# coding. 
            There was a lot of trial and error to clear these errors.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some logic errors in the code would make objects not function as they should. 
            Most of these fixes were done through trial and error to get them to work.
